This is the wallet class, which is used to create a wallet object, and the wallet object contains the following functions:
1.deposit: which is used to deposit money.
2.withdraw: which is used to withdraw money.
3.transfer to wallets: which is used to transfer money to other wallets of the same customer.
4.transfer to other_customers: which is used to transfer money to other customers.

Wallets are created by the customer class, and the customer class will create wallet objects for each customer.
All functions are written in the wallet class, and then create 4 subclasses to inherit all the methods and variables of the parent class.
When the wallet corresponding to the subclass has no function, rewrite the method of the parent class to achieve functional controlã€‚
